Slope Soaring Simulator (SSS) by Danny Chapman. 
See license.txt or the GNU General Public License for details. 

Windows: Run sss.exe directly, or run it via one of the .bat files in
         the batch_files folder.

Linux etc: Go into src, tweak the Makefile, and compile. Make sure you
           have installed the necessary libraries (PLIB, GLUI, FMOD
           GLUT etc). 

Mac OSX-10.3.4 or higher: Not tested this myself but you should be able to
           go into src, tweak the makefile and compile with 
           "make -f Makefile.osx".

In either case, have a look in the "doc" directory, or on

  code so that it can run the Crrcsim gliders.

* The authors of PLIB, GLUI, FMOD and GLUT.

* Lionel Cailler for some Mac OSX tweaks (though I'm not sure I've
  incoporated all of them...)
