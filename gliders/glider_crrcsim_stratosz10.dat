# Basic engine properties
begin engine
name engine
# max min_force > max_force to flip the sense of the controlling channel
min_force 0   # force in Newtons for when control is min
max_force 22  # force in Newtons (mass * 10 * 2) for when control is max
max_airspeed 50 # airspeed (m/s) at which the engine becomes useless
control_per_chan_3 1 # indicates what channel is used for this engine
end engine
