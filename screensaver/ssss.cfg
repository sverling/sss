E:/code/SSS_Demo_CD/sss/sss

Configuration for Slope Soaring Simulator Screensaver (SSSS).

The first line of this file must contain the complete location of sss.exe,
as above. Note that I've used forward slashes - this is important.

Everything other than the first line in this file is ignored.

This file MUST reside in C:\SSS.cfg

Ugly, but then that's just life!
