This directory contains the source, exe and instructions for the Slope Soaring Simulator Screensaver (SSSS - note the extra 's').

Note that this is only for use under MS Windows (and I've only tried it under XP Home).

I would advise against installing SSSS if you have any problems running SSS normally.

1. Installation. 

Should be straightforward, but follow these instructions carefuly, and let me know if you spot any errors.

1.1. Copy ssss.cfg from this directory to C:\ssss.cfg

1.2 Edit C:\ssss.cfg (e.g. with wordpad) and change JUST the first line to reflect where SSS lives on your computer.

1.3 Before going any further, test things: Come back to this directory and run ssss.scr by double-clicking on it. It should run SSS in full-screen, quitting as soon as you move the mouse/press a key. Don't go any further until you get this working!

1.4 Copy ssss.scr into C:\WINDOWS\system32

1.5. Open your Display properties, find the screensaver tab, and select the SSS screensaver. For some reason this appears as just "ss" on my machine - don't know why - I expected "ssss".

1.6 Test it by using the preview button. Note that the settings button won't do anything (and you won't see anything in the little monitor piccy either).

1.7 Click on OK.

That's it. Hope it worked!

2. Compiling SSSS

2.1 I've included the MSVC6.0 project files - it should compile very easily. ssss.scr is simply the ssss.exe rename.

2.2 Now fix everything that's evil!
