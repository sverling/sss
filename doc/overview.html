<h3>1. DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>This is a free, open source gliding simulator (mainly for
radio-controlled slope-soaring gliders). 'Features' include:
<ul>

<li> Very realistic aerodynamics. I learnt to fly radio-controlled
     gliders using this simulator!

<li> Fly against "robot" pilots that attempt to stay aloft, chase you,
  and fire missiles at you.

<li> Race/combat/free-fly modes

<li> Basic networking - currently between two simulations
  (peer-peer).

<li> Collisions between gliders and other objects (mainly each other,
missiles and the ground).

<li> Wind field is precalculated using a (3rd party) numerical
  simulation of airflow over the terrain, or can be generated on the
  fly (as can the terrain), including effects such as thermals and
  boundary layers.

<li> OpenGL is used for the 3D graphics. FMOD for 3D sound. 

<li> Terrain is simplified using the Lindstrom/Pascucci (2001)
  view-dependant level-of-detail algorithm with geo-morphing and
  view-frustrum culling. This allows large and/or detailed terrains.

<li> Quite a few things are modifiable at run-time via a GUI, and almost
  everything is modifiable via text configuration files.

<li> Compiles and runs under Windows, Linux and Solaris and Mac OS X.

</ul>

<h3>2. INSTALLATION:</h3>

<ol>
<li> Windows (pre-compiled version)
<ol>
<li> If this is on a CD, then things should run OK from
   there. However, reading terrain data from the CD may be slow (at
   least at first, before it gets paged into memory). It is probably
   better to use Winzip to to put the contents of this CD onto a
   hard-drive using sss_demo.zip.

<li> Run sss.exe to have a slightly interactive startup, or one of
    the .bat files (such as run_builtin_demo.bat) to use a specific
    configuration.

<li> By default sss.exe uses sss.cfg as a configuration
     file. Edit sss.cfg (e.g. with notepad or wordpad) to change the
     behaviour (obviously not possible if you're running direct from
     a CD!).
</ol>

<li>Linux
<ol>
<li> Ensure that you have OpenGL (or Mesa) and GLUT
   headers/libraries. Also GLUI, plib and FMOD (though you can tweak
   the Makefile to build without these last 3).

<li> Check that the Makefile looks OK, then build using make/gmake. It
should place the executable, "sss", in the parent directory.

<li> Edit sss.cfg (etc) if you want.

<li> Run sss (which will have been put in the directory above the
Makefile).
</ol>
</ol>

<h3>3. RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<p>Basically, if you have problems getting things to work, turn off
the expensive-looking options in sss.cfg - in particular set the
texture_level to 1. If things do work, on the other hand, and if
you've got a decent computer, you can try "turning up" the parameters
in sss.cfg. Many parameters can be modified by pressing 'c' when
the program is running.

<p>When you run it, you'll start in a paused mode - 'p' toggles pause.

<p>To fly, the mouse acts like the top of a joystick - center it by
moving the pointer to the center of the screen (when the plane is, if
you're in the body view). The right mouse-button gives you an extra
boost, for when things go wrong... If you have a joystick, it should
work if you press 'j'. As a last resort, the arrow keys will work too
(if you're in mouse mode - press 'm' if in doubt).

<p> Keeping the glider up in the air involves staying in the region
where air is being lifted up over the hill - press and hold 'w' for a
few seconds to see some wind arrows (press 'W' to get rid of
them). Try and keep to the region immediately in front of the starting
location. It takes a while to get the hang of it!

<p>For a full list of keys and their actions, press 'h' (for help).

<h3>4. PROBLEMS</h3>

I have done a lot of testing to make sure that this program is free
from bugs - there may be a few behavioural bugs lurking, but having
run it under Solaris and Windows using Purify I am confident that it
does not produce any bad memory accesses etc. 

However, if you do experience problems running it, please let me know.

<h3>5. MULTIPLAYER</h3>

<p>Multiplayer is still very much work-in-progress. To run it, you
need to specify some extra options, and under Windows run it by hand
from a command prompt:

<p>sss [port to listen on] [ip-addr1] [port1]

<p>It will use the default configuration file, sss.cfg.

<p>Lets say you want to run the simulator on two computers, 135.96.54.24
and 134.96.55.12:

<p>on 135.96.54.24 use sss 10001 134.96.55.12 10002
<p>on 134.96.55.12 use sss 10002 135.96.54.24 10001

<p>When each instance of sss starts it will wait in an initialisation
phase for connections from the other simulations. Only when it
receives the expected connection will it start. Once it is running it
won't accept any new connections.

<p>You can tweak a couple of parameters in the sss.cfg file.

<p><b>NOTE:</b> You need to have the same configuration files for each
of the simulations. You can tweak some things (e.g. window size,
graphics options etc), but nothing that really affects the simulation
- e.g. terrain generation parameters etc. otherwise confusion will
follow... This is work-in-progress, remember!

<p> Thanks for taking the time to try it - Danny.
