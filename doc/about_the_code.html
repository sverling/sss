<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I hope that you're reading this because you've run the simulator
and are interested in the nitty-gritty details of how it's been
implemented. Consequently, I also want to point out some of the areas
that I can imagine being improved (before you do!) - encountering
these issues has taught me a lot.

<p>The history of this project is that it started out as a brief
experimentation with OpenGL (with a laptop during a camping holiday in
France!). I've always had an interest in numerical simulations, and I
wanted to be able to visualise some of the things I'd been thinking
about. I was also intrigued as to how well aircraft could be
represented a collection of independent aerofoils. Subsequent
development has been continuous and incremental, and on the way I have
learned more than I ever though I would about rendering, aerodynamics,
physics simulations, and general programming/game design. One of the
things I've learnt is that this simulator does pretty well all of
these things "wrong"! Even though it has been my sand-pit for
experimenting, I think that the end result works well - it certainly
does more than I ever thought it would.

<p>Now I know what I have done wrong, I also have many ideas about how
to do things better. What follows is a critical discussion of some of
these issues.

<h3>Physics</h3>
<ul>

<li> The integration of the equations of motion is shared between the
     physics module and each object. Whilst this was not initially a
     problem (when I thought that the glider would be the only object)
     it now results in a certain amount of code duplication. It also
     means that it is not practical to go beyond 2nd order Range-Kutta
     integration (actually I use a slightly modified 2nd order scheme
     that is a little more accurate).

		 <p>Having said that, from a pragmatic point of view I'm not sure
		 that the simulation necessarily <it>needs</it> to go beyond a 2nd
		 order scheme. What would be more useful is an adaptive
		 time-stepping scheme where different objects use different
		 time-steps. This would let me run many more robots on my slow
		 computer! Nevertheless, the current organisation is limiting - it
		 would make it hard to introduce other types of bodies into the
		 simulation.

<li> Collision is done using a spring/mass model. This is actually
     perfectly good for the vast majority of the time - it's a flight
     simulator so objects are mostly flying! However, ground
     interaction and mid-air collisions could be better. I am very
     interested in re-writing this aspect in terms of non-penetrating
     rigid bodies. I even think it might be fun!

</ul>

<h3>Graphics</h3>

<ul>

<li> The graphics rendering is rather distributed at the moment - with
     no real coordination between objects as regards texture usage,
     OpenGL state and so-on. There is room for a lot of improvement
     here.

<li> I became very interested in CLOD terrain rendering
     algorithms - the terrain plays a significant role in the overall
     feel of the simulator, and is also a potentially large drain on
     the CPU. There are three aspects that would be interesting to
     improve:
		 <ol>
		 <li> Using a separate terrain-simplification thread that
          calculates the terrain triangle strip(s), but does not
          render them. Each strip could last several frames. This
          would allow multiple terrain rendering passes, and would
          also prevent glitches when new terrain needs to be paged in
          from file.
     <li> Using separate tiles for the terrain. This would allow more
          sensible terrain storage on disk, including having large
          terrains that are not square. It would also mean that
          textures do not have to be so spread out.
     <li> The terrain needs to provide height information for
          collision detection and wind-field calculation. There's room
          for improvement here, especially in terms of reducing the
          memory usage (and hopefully improving cache usage).
     </ol>

<li> There is probably a case for avoiding any CLOD algorithm - a
     reasonably recent CPU/GPU could probably cope with rendering
     quite large terrains (larger than I tend to use) quicker by
     storing all the information on the graphics card itself. However,
     it would limit support for older machines.

<li> There is quite a lot of scope for more flashy graphics - particle
     effects for explosions, a decent animated cloud layer, texture
     splatting of detail onto the terrain etc. To do this the
     rendering structure needs to be tidied up, so that there is a
     central render-manager that allows components to register
     themselves for pre-render work (e.g. calculating shadow
     textures), normal rendering, transparent rendering (with
     sorting), and overlays.

</ul>

<h3>Robot glider AI</h3>

<ul>

<li> Flying a glider from point A to B in a straight line (without
     getting blown down-wind etc) is not trivial. Deciding on exactly
     where the robot should fly to (and the path to reach it) is very
     hard, at least for a robot glider that (a) can only use updrafts
     to keep flying and (b) is trying to chase another glider without
     crashing.

<li> Currently the robots use some simple heuristics to choose where
		 to fly, largely based on the idea that "if the human wants to fly
		 here, then there's probably enough lift to keep me aloft too". To
		 do this properly, and to take things further, the robot AI should
		 be implemented as a formal state machine incorporating desires on
		 different time-scales - e.g. "Chase glider X for the next 30
		 seconds" at the same time as "avoid this hill that is coming
		 towards me rather quickly". It also needs to be able to "predict"
		 where lift is likely to be - preferably without cheating(!) - and
		 plan a path from A to B that takes it through regions of
		 sufficient lift.

<li> The robot AI is potentially a very interesting topic, largely
		 because of the constraints imposed by the nature of the
		 simulation. It has also taught me that "cheating" can be very
		 effective - the robots come across as being much clever than they
		 really are!

</ul>

<h3>Networking</h3>
<ul>

<li> Making a true multi-player version would be a significant, and
     interesting, step. Due to the symmetric interactions between the
     objects (i.e. glider-glider collisions) a peer-peer version of
     this simulation will always have problems, and would not scale
     well to many players.

<li> A client-server model is my favoured approach. However, each
     client will be very sensitive to conflicts with the server, so
     there would have to be a means where client/server conflicts were
     generally resolved in favour of the client, in those cases where
     other clients were not involved. In the case of collisions
     between gliders on two different clients, slight glitches in the
     client representation would be acceptable, given the violent
     nature of such events.

<li> The lag/jitter correction algorithms currently in place could
     probably be improved and simplified - they are certainly needed
     for combat-style flying against remote opponents. Typical
     internet lag would make an opponent be out of place by a distance
     much larger than the size of a glider.

<li> The current networking layer is slightly odd because it started
     life as a very different design...!

<li> The issue of using compatable configuration on the different
     machines needs to be addressed. It would be possible to serialise
     all the configuration, and make each client download it from the
     server. However, this would not be practical for some aspects
     (textures and models) - where local copies would be needed (could
     be checked using checksums).

</ul>

<h3>General structure</h3>
<ul>
<li> Ownership of some of the objects is a little murky - there needs
     to be a central game object that maintains a database of all the
     objects in a generic sense and does general book-keeping. There
     is currently too much "juggling" where objects rely on details of
     other objects' behaviour. I intend to do the very substantial job
     of tidying up these relationships, as part of the
     physics/networking development I have planned.

<li> Configuration is a mixture of being good (the Config_file class
     works well) and not so good (Config has turned into a
     monster!). Now that there is a race mode, I can see room for more
     supporting scripted behaviour - e.g. of the robot AI.

<li> A clean division of the code between graphical and non-graphical
     parts would have the added benefit that the non-graphical part
     (including the physics engine) could be re-used as a stand-alone
     server (I already have offers of hosts!).

<li> The current implementation makes it difficult to remove some
     components (e.g. the terrain) and replace them with a substitute
     (i.e. a different terrain) at run-time.

<li> The general user-interface deserves more work.

</ul>

<p> So, I have been learning all the time whilst working on this
project. I know that whatever I do next, with this or a different
project, I will build on what I have learnt, and there will be a whole
host of new, exciting things to find out about!
